_A location based social networking platform curated by the community, driven by you_ 💛

Periferi experiments with a new approach to networking.

A Periferi could be any region around you. It could be your neighbourhood, your college, a school etc.
If you create a request for a new Periferi, and a certain number of active users present in that area approve your request, that Periferi gets created and thus a community is formed!

Based on your location, you can read, interact and socialize with people in that Periferi. Choosing a Periferi you want to interact with  is simple:
  - Pinch in to enter a smaller Periferi
  - Pinch out to check out posts from a larger Periferi around you.

Add posts about local attractions, delicious food joints or new happenings nearby. Learn and strengthen communities, one Periferi at a time ⭐️
